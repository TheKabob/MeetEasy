## Project Structure

There are 2 folders Front-end and Backend
### Front-End
1. Index.html is the login page
2. register.html is the register page
3. jitse-meet.html is a basic html page which you get once you register for jaas [jitsi-as-as-service](https://jaas.8x8.vc/#/)
4. forgot.html and reset.html can be configured accordingly
5. Inside /Landing folder you have index.html which is the primary landing page. If you click on "Try now" button from ths landing page, it will redirect you to login page

### Backend
#### Backend for this project is implemented on python using FastApi and Postgres database to store user data
1. The backend folder is structured in Model, service, controller fashion
2. Model folder has model.py which has classes which create the required models
3. In Dao (Data access layer) we have the actual implementation logic of login and register functionality
4. login_register_service.py has the endpoint logic for login and register
5. settings.py is used to fetch the environment variables, we need some enviroment variables which will be used to create a connection between backend and database.

### Database 
setup a local postgres database or any SQL database of your choice, create a "users" table which can store user data in it.
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);
```
## Running the project locally

To run this project locally:
1. Take a clone of this repository: ```git clone https://github.com/shashankshet/MeetEasy.git```
2. Open a terminal and change directory to Front-end ```cd front-end```
3. Now you need to host this front-end locally, to do that run
```python
python -m http.server
```
This will locally host your front-end code

4. Now open the backend folder in the choice of your code editor
5. In edit Config add your environtment varibles which are related to the database:
``` HOST: localhost
PORT: portnumber where db is hosted
DATABASE: name of the database
USER: username
PASSWORD: password of db
```
6. now you can run the file login_register_service.py.
This will host your backend in localhost

If you run into some problem, recheck the port number where your backend is hosted and accordingly updated the url in login.js and register.js files in front-end directory
